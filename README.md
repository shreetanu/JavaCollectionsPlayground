# Java Data Structures Practice Repository

## 📌 About This Repository
This repository contains my hands-on practice and experiments with Java Collections API, Lists, PriorityQueue, Streams, and other data structures. The goal is to build a strong foundation in Java while exploring different implementations and use cases.


## 🚀 Technologies Used
- **Java** (JDK 17 or later)
- **IntelliJ IDEA** (Recommended IDE)
- **Collections API** (List, Set, Queue, Map)
- **Streams API**

## 📚 Topics Covered
✅ **Lists** (ArrayList, LinkedList)  
✅ **Queues** (PriorityQueue)  
✅ **Streams & Functional Programming**  
✅ **Sorting & Searching Algorithms** *(To be added)*  
✅ **Custom Comparators & Lambdas** *(To be added)*  

## 🛠️ How to Run the Code
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/java-data-structures-practice.git
   ```
2. Open the project in **IntelliJ IDEA**.
3. Ensure the correct **JDK version** is set up.
4. Navigate to the class you want to run and execute the `main()` method.

## 🔥 Future Plans
- Implement **HashMap & TreeMap** examples
- Add **Graph & Tree traversal algorithms**
- Explore **Concurrency utilities**
